                <h1 style="text-shadow:4px 4px 4px aqua;"><b>What's a dog breed?</b>  </h1>
                <p>People have been breeding dogs since prehistoric times. The earliest dog breeders used wolves to create domestic dogs. From the beginning, humans purposefully bred dogs to perform various tasks. Hunting, guarding, and herding are thought to be among the earliest jobs eagerly performed by the animal destined to be called “man’s best friend.”</p>
            <p>For thousands of years, humans bred dogs toward the physical and mental traits best suited for the work expected of them. The sleek Greyhound types bred to chase fleet-footed prey, and the huge mastiff types used as guard dogs and warriors, are two ancient examples of dogs bred for specific jobs. </p> 
           <p>Each breed’s ideal physical traits, movement, and temperament are set down in a written document called a “breed standard.” For example, the breed standard sets forth the traits that make a Cocker Spaniel a Cocker Spaniel and not a Springer Spaniel.</p>
            <p>There are over 340 dog breeds known throughout the world. The American Kennel Club recognizes 193 breeds.</p>
        <h3 style="text-shadow: 3px 3px 3px aqua"><b>Importance of Dog</b> </h3>
        <p>Dogs are important to humans in all kinds of ways. The connection between the two goes back thousands of years.</p>
    <p>A dog can use its sensitive nose to help humans, too. At airports, some dogs sniff out luggage to make sure people aren’t bringing anything they shouldn’t on the plane. In some cases, dogs can even sniff out cancer in people.</p>
